# Child Safety Standards & CSAE Prevention Policy

**Effective Date:** February 15, 2026

At DiwanAnkara, we are committed to providing a safe environment for all our users. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and the exploitation of children. This document outlines our standards and procedures for preventing, detecting, and reporting such content.

## 1. Zero Tolerance for CSAM
We strictly prohibit the upload, sharing, or distribution of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) on our platform. Any content found to be in violation of this policy will be removed immediately, and the accounts responsible will be permanently banned.

## 2. Content Monitoring and Moderation
While our application is primarily an informational portal with curated content, we actively monitor all user interactions (if any) and content submissions to ensure compliance with our safety standards.

## 3. Reporting Mechanism
We encourage our community to report any content or behavior that they believe violates our child safety standards.

- **In-App Reporting:** If you encounter any suspicious content, you can report it directly by contacting us through the "Support Us" or "Contact" sections in the app.
- **Email Reporting:** You can urge immediate action by contacting our designated safety officer at: **ahm3dbusinesss@gmail.com**

## 4. Cooperation with Law Enforcement
We are committed to cooperating fully with law enforcement agencies and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). If we detect any CSAM or receive a valid report, we will:
1.  Make a report to NCMEC (CyberTipline).
2.  Preserve the evidence as required by law.
3.  Remove the content from our platform.
4.  Terminate the user's access.

## 5. Contact Information
For any inquiries regarding our child safety standards or to report a violation, please contact:
